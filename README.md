This MERN stack application allows users to create an account, login, and search for books. Via GoogleBooks API, when a user searches for a book they will populate on the page. The user can save a book to their account as a favorite, and when logged in can revisit the saved books. When the user logs out, they can still view books but not save any as favorites.
